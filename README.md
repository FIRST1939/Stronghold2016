## About the Robot
The 2016 game, Stronghold, required robots to cross defenses and score boulders in either the low or high goals. Our robot, The Trojan Rabbot, was designed to be sturdy and cross defenses easily with a powerful six wheel drivetrain. We then opted to only score balls in the low goal. The addition of an arm on the front allowed for picking up balls, scoring balls, and crossing the Cheval de Frise.
